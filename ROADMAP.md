Hexa software has two main components, the policy admin app and the orchestrator. Future enhancements can be associated with one or both of these components. The following list captures some of the initial roadmap items that will be prioritized and this list will, of course, evolve over time as new use cases and requirements are explored.

- Add new connector and support for Snowflake database
